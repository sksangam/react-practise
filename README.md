# React Udemy Practice Projects

This repository contains all my practice projects from the Udemy course [React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)] by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

## Structure

- Each folder is a separate project (e.g., `1-investment-calculator`).
- All projects use Vite + TypeScript + shadcn + lucide.
- You can navigate into any project and run/install dependencies as needed.

## Getting Started

To work on a specific project:

```
cd <project-folder>
npm install
npm run dev
```
